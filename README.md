*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*:
             First task, Designing and developing an interactive quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was one of the tasks entrusted to me during my internship in frontend web development. The task was assigned to test whether one could build a user-friendly responsive web interface for dynamically loading questions, accepting user input, handling real-time feedback, and keeping track of scores and progress.

>Tools and Technologies Used:
>Code Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
>Languages: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (vanilla)
>Other tools: Browser for testing, GitHub for version control and deployment

>Task Performed:

The task started with creating the HTML layout of the app. Elements were defined for the question box, answer input area, submit-and-reset buttons, feedback messages, score display, and progress bar. The quiz handled two types of questions:

A text input-type question, where the user types in an answer.
A multiple-choice-question-type question, where answers are selected by clicking applicable options with radio buttons.
Once the layout was defined, I went on and applied CSS onto the app. The style was simple and readable, yet the main emphasis was on keeping the interface clean and centered on the input.
