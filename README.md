*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*:
            First task. Designing and developing an interactive quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was one of my assignments during my internship in frontend web development. This task aimed to see if I could create a user-friendly, responsive web interface for loading questions, accepting user input, providing real-time feedback, and tracking scores and progress.

> Tools and Technologies Used:
> Code Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
> Languages: HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
> Other tools: Browser for testing, GitHub for version control and deployment

> Task Performed:

I began by creating the HTML layout of the app. I defined elements for the question box, answer input area, submit and reset buttons, feedback messages, score display, and progress bar. The quiz handled two types of questions:

A text input question, where the user types in an answer.
A multiple-choice question, where users select answers by clicking options with radio buttons. 
Once the layout was set, I applied CSS to the app. The style was simple and readable, focusing on keeping the interface clean and centered on the input.
